         <h3>ABOUT SUUBI COMMUNITY PROJECTS UGANDA</h3>
         <p>Suubi Community Projects Uganda (SUUBI) is a community based organization founded in 2013 and incorporated on the  16th of June 2015. SUUBI is a Luganda word that means Hope; in all our activities we strive to restore hope where it has been lost. As a community based and self-help organization, all our projects start within the beneficiary communities and are sustained by the communities themselves. Thus, we "help communities to help themselves". The organization has 5 permanent staff and 13 contract staff. <b>The organization currently operates in the districts of Mukono,
Hoima, Ibanda, Kayunga and Kyegegwa.</b></p></section>
